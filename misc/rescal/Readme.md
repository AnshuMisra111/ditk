## Original Code
[Python module to compute the RESCAL tensor factorization](https://github.com/mnick/rescal.py)

## Overview
* Rescal factorizes each slice of tensor X into 2 matrices A and R<sub>k</sub> using Alternating Least Square (ALS) approach
* A tensor entry X<sub>ijk</sub> = 1 denotes that there exists a relation (i-th entity, k-th predicate, j-th entity)

* Matrix A contains the latent component representation of the entities in the domain
* Matrix R<sub>k</sub> models the interactions of the latent components in the k-th predicate

## Inputs and Outputs
### Inputs
* Tensor model X in MATLAB binary data format (.mat)
    * Shape of X is n * n * m
* Rank r

### Outputs
* For each frontal slice of the tensor X (X<sub>k</sub>):
    * Matrix A (n * r)
    * Matrix R<sub>k</sub> (r * r)
* Matrix A and a list R (which contains matrix R<sub>k</sub> for all values of k) are outputted to text files "rescal_output_A.txt" and "rescal_output_R.txt" respectively

## Evalution
### Benchmark datasets
1. Alyawarra kinship data
    * Collected by Denham
    * 104 entities
    * 26 relations

2. UMLS dataset from a biomedical ontology
    * Prepared by McCray et al.
    * 135 entities
    * 49 relations
    
3. Human disease-symptoms data resource 
    * Prepared by Zitnik et al.
    * 1578 entities
    * 3 relations

### Evaluation metrics
For both training and testing data:
* Mean of Precision Recall Area Under Curve (PR AUC)
* Standard deviation of PR AUC
