## Overview
* Rescal factorizes each slice of tensor X into 2 matrices A and R<sub>k</sub> using Alternating Least Square (ALS) approach

![rescal](rescal.png)

* Matrix A contains the latent component representation of the entities in the domain
* Matrix R<sub>k</sub> models the interactions of the latent components in the k-th predicate

## Input/Output format for the model
### Inputs
* Tensor model X (n * n * m)
* Rank r

### Outputs
For each frontal slice of the tensor X (X<sub>k</sub>):
* Matrix A (n * r)
* Matrix R<sub>k</sub> (r * r)

## Benchmark datasets
1. Alyawarra kinship data
    * Collected by Denham
    * 104 entities
    * 26 relations

2. UMLS dataset from a biomedical ontology
    * Prepared by McCray et al.
    * 135 entities
    * 49 relations
    
3. Human disease-symptoms data resource 
    * Prepared by Zitnik et al.
    * 1578 entities
    * 3 relations

## Evaluation metrics and results
### Evaluation metrics
For both training and testing data:
* Mean of Precision Recall Area Under Curve (PR AUC)
* Standard deviation of PR AUC
