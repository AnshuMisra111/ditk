The present studies demon@@ st@@ rate that growth and vitamin D treatment enh@@ ance the ext@@ ent of artery calcification in rats given suffici@@ ent doses of W@@ ar@@ farin to inhib@@ it gamma@@ -@@ carb@@ ox@@ yl@@ ation of mat@@ ri@@ x G@@ l@@ a protein@@ , a calcification inhibitor known to be ex@@ press@@ ed by smo@@ oth musc@@ le cells and mac@@ ro@@ ph@@ ages in the artery w@@ all@@ . The first seri@@ es of experim@@ ents examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in W@@ ar@@ farin -treated rats. Treat@@ ment for 2 weeks with W@@ ar@@ farin caused mas@@ sive foc@@ al calcification of the artery medi@@ a in 20@@ -@@ day@@ -old rats and less exten@@ sive foc@@ al calcification in 4@@ 2-@@ day@@ -old rats. In contrast@@ , no artery calcification could be det@@ ected in 10-@@ month@@ -old ad@@ ult rats even after 4 weeks of W@@ ar@@ farin treatment. To direc@@ tly ex@@ amine the import@@ ance of growth to W@@ ar@@ farin -induced artery calcification in animals of the same age, 20@@ -@@ day@@ -old rats were f@@ ed for 2 weeks either an ad li@@ b@@ it@@ um diet or a 6-@@ g/@@ d re@@ stric@@ ted diet that maint@@ ain@@ s weight but prev@@ ents grow@@ th@@ . Con@@ current treatment of both di@@ et@@ ary groups with W@@ ar@@ farin produced mas@@ sive foc@@ al calcification of the artery medi@@ a in the ad li@@ b@@ it@@ um@@ -@@ f@@ ed rats but no det@@ ect@@ able artery calcification in the re@@ stric@@ te@@ d-@@ di@@ et@@ , grow@@ th@@ -@@ inhibited group. Although the expl@@ an@@ ation for the association between artery calcification and growth status can@@ not be determined from the present study, there was a rel@@ ationship between higher serum phosph@@ ate and sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ b@@ ility to artery calcification , with 3@@ 0% higher levels of serum phosph@@ ate in youn@@ g@@ , ad li@@ b@@ it@@ um@@ -@@ f@@ ed rats compared with either of the groups that was resist@@ ant to W@@ ar@@ farin -induced artery calcification , i@@ e, the 10-@@ month@@ -old rats and the re@@ stric@@ te@@ d-@@ di@@ et@@ , grow@@ th@@ -@@ inhibited youn@@ g rats. This observ@@ ation suggests that increased sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ b@@ ility to W@@ ar@@ farin -induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosph@@ ate level@@ s. The second set of experim@@ ents examined the possible syn@@ erg@@ y between vitamin D and W@@ ar@@ farin in artery calcification . H@@ i@@ gh doses of vitamin D are known to cause calcification of the artery medi@@ a in as lit@@ t@@ le as 3 to 4 days. H@@ i@@ gh doses of the vitamin K antagonist W@@ ar@@ farin are also known to cause calcification of the artery medi@@ a, but at treatment times of 2 weeks or long@@ er y@@ et not at 1 week@@ . In the current study, we investigated the syn@@ erg@@ y between these 2 treat@@ ments and found that con@@ current W@@ ar@@ farin administration d@@ ram@@ ati@@ c@@ ally increased the ext@@ ent of calcification in the medi@@ a of vitamin D -treated rats at 3 and 4 days. There was a clo@@ se par@@ al@@ le@@ l between the effect of vitamin D dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin D dose on the elev@@ ation of serum calcium , which suggests that vitamin D may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calcium . B@@ ecause W@@ ar@@ farin treatment had no effect on the elev@@ ation in serum calcium produced by vitamin D , the syn@@ erg@@ y between W@@ ar@@ farin and vitamin D is prob@@ ably b@@ est expl@@ ained by the hypo@@ thesis that W@@ ar@@ farin inhibit@@ s the activity of mat@@ ri@@ x G@@ l@@ a protein as a calcification inhibitor@@ . H@@ i@@ gh levels of mat@@ ri@@ x G@@ l@@ a protein are found at sit@@ es of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin D plus W@@ ar@@ farin , and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accum@@ ul@@ ated was in@@ de@@ ed not gamma@@ -@@ carb@@ ox@@ yl@@ ated . These observ@@ ations indicate that although the gamma@@ -@@ carb@@ oxy@@ glutamate re@@ si@@ du@@ es of mat@@ ri@@ x G@@ l@@ a protein are appa@@ ren@@ tly requ@@ ired for its function as a calcification inhibitor@@ , they are not requ@@ ired for its accum@@ ulation at calcification sit@@ es.

BACKGROUND: We clin@@ ically and path@@ olog@@ ically analy@@ zed renal allogra@@ f@@ ts from 1 9 renal transplant patients treated with tacrolimus ( FK50@@ 6 ) for more than 1 year@@ . METHODS: Tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ six renal allogra@@ ft biop@@ sy spec@@ imen@@ s from 1 9 renal transplant patients who under@@ w@@ ent transplant@@ ations between 19@@ 9@@ 1 and 19@@ 9@@ 3 were evalu@@ ated.

RESULTS: The ma@@ in path@@ ologic diagno@@ ses (@@ some over@@ l@@ ap@@ ) were acute re@@ j@@ ection (A@@ R@@ ; n = 4@@ ), chronic re@@ j@@ ection (C@@ R@@ ; n@@ =@@ 5@@ ), A@@ R@@ +@@ C@@ R (n =@@ 4@@ ), recur@@ rent I@@ g@@ A nephro@@ pathy (n =@@ 5@@ ), normal findings (n =@@ 2@@ ), minim@@ al@@ -@@ type chronic FK50@@ 6 nephro@@ pathy (n = 9@@ ), and mil@@ d-@@ type FK50@@ 6 nephro@@ pathy (n = 1@@ 1). Of the non@@ episo@@ de biop@@ si@@ es, 7 and 4 biop@@ si@@ es showed minim@@ al@@ -@@ type and mil@@ d-@@ type chronic FK50@@ 6 nephro@@ pathy , respectively.

BACKGROUND: An association has been found between transplant glomer@@ ulo@@ pathy ( T@@ G ) and re@@ du@@ plic@@ ation of per@@ it@@ ub@@ ular cap@@ ill@@ ary bas@@ ement membran@@ es (P@@ T@@ CR@@ ). Although such an association is of p@@ rac@@ tical and the@@ ore@@ tical import@@ ance@@ , only one pro@@ sp@@ ective study has tri@@ ed to con@@ fir@@ m it@@ . METHODS: We examined 27@@ 8 con@@ sec@@ utive renal spec@@ imen@@ s (@@ from 13@@ 5 transplant@@ s and 14@@ 3 n@@ ative kidne@@ ys@@ ) for ult@@ ra@@ struct@@ ural evidence of P@@ T@@ CR@@ . In addition to renal allogra@@ f@@ ts with T@@ G , we also examined gra@@ f@@ ts with acute re@@ j@@ ec@@ tion, recur@@ rent glomerul@@ one@@ ph@@ ritis , chronic allogra@@ ft nephro@@ pathy and st@@ able gra@@ f@@ ts (@@ "@@ pro@@ to@@ co@@ l biop@@ si@@ es@@ "@@ ). N@@ ative kidney spec@@ imen@@ s included a w@@ ide range of glomer@@ ulo@@ path@@ i@@ es as well as cases of thrombotic microangio@@ pathy , mal@@ i@@ gn@@ ant hypertension , acute interstitial neph@@ ritis , and acute tub@@ ular necro@@ sis . RESULTS: We found P@@ T@@ C@@ R in 14 of 15 cases of T@@ G , in 7 transplant biop@@ sy spec@@ imen@@ s without T@@ G , and in 13 of 14@@ 3 n@@ ative kidney biop@@ sy spec@@ imen@@ s. These 13 included cases of mal@@ i@@ gn@@ ant hypertension , thrombotic microangio@@ pathy , lu@@ p@@ us neph@@ ritis , H@@ en@@ och@@ -@@ S@@ ch@@ on@@ le@@ in neph@@ ritis , c@@ res@@ c@@ en@@ tic glomerul@@ one@@ ph@@ ritis , and cocaine -@@ related acute renal failure . M@@ il@@ d P@@ T@@ C@@ R in allogra@@ f@@ ts without T@@ G did not predic@@ t renal failure or significant proteinuria after follow-up perio@@ ds of between 3 months and 1 year@@ . CONCLUSIONS: We concl@@ ude that in transplant@@ s, there is a st@@ ron@@ g association between we@@ ll@@ -@@ developed P@@ T@@ C@@ R and T@@ G , while the signific@@ ance of mil@@ d P@@ T@@ C@@ R and its predic@@ tive valu@@ e in the absence of T@@ G is unc@@ lear@@ . P@@ T@@ C@@ R also occur@@ s in cer@@ t@@ ain n@@ ative kidney diseas@@ es , though the association is not as st@@ ron@@ g as that for T@@ G . We suggest that repe@@ ated endothelial injury , including immun@@ ologic injury , may be the cause of this le@@ sion both in allogra@@ f@@ ts and n@@ ative kidne@@ y@@ s.

Th@@ ir@@ t@@ y P@@ D patients partic@@ ip@@ ated in the study. A second echocardiograph@@ y was performed (@@ median inter@@ val@@ : 13 month@@ s) after per@@ g@@ ol@@ ide withdrawal (n@@ =@@ 10 patient@@ s@@ ). C@@ ont@@ ro@@ l@@ s were ag@@ e@@ - and sex@@ -@@ mat@@ ch@@ ed non@@ - P@@ D patients ref@@ er@@ red to the cardi@@ ology de@@ part@@ ment. RESULTS: Com@@ pared to control@@ s, a@@ or@@ tic reg@@ ur@@ g@@ it@@ ation (@@ O@@ R@@ : 3.@@ 1@@ ; 95% IC@@ : 1.@@ 1-@@ 8.@@ 8@@ ) and mit@@ ral reg@@ ur@@ g@@ it@@ ation (@@ O@@ R@@ : 1@@ 0.@@ 7@@ ; 95% IC@@ : 2.@@ 1-@@ 5@@ 3@@ ) were more frequent in P@@ D patients (@@ tr@@ ic@@ us@@ pid@@ : N@@ S@@ ).

S@@ e@@ ver@@ ity of reg@@ ur@@ g@@ it@@ ation was not cor@@ related with per@@ g@@ ol@@ ide cum@@ ul@@ ative dose. A re@@ stric@@ tive pat@@ ter@@ n of val@@ v@@ ular reg@@ ur@@ g@@ it@@ ation , sugg@@ es@@ tive of the role of per@@ g@@ ol@@ ide , was observed in 12@@ /@@ 30 (4@@ 0@@ %) patients including two with heart failure .

METHODS: A revie@@ w of ad@@ mis@@ sions during a 6-@@ year period revealed 14 patients with cocaine -@@ related aneurys@@ ms . This group was compared with a control group of 13@@ 5 patients with ru@@ pt@@ ured aneurys@@ ms and no hist@@ ory of cocaine ab@@ use . A@@ ge at present@@ ation, time of ic@@ t@@ us after in@@ toxic@@ ation, H@@ un@@ t and H@@ ess gra@@ de of sub@@ arac@@ h@@ no@@ id hemorrh@@ age , size of the aneurys@@ m , loc@@ ation of the aneurys@@ m , and the G@@ las@@ go@@ w O@@ ut@@ com@@ e S@@ cal@@ e scor@@ e were assessed and com@@ pa@@ red. RESULTS: The patients in the study group were significantly youn@@ g@@ er than the patients in the control group (P < 0.00@@ 2@@ ). In patients in the study group@@ , all aneurys@@ ms were loc@@ ated in the an@@ ter@@ ior cir@@ cul@@ ation. The maj@@ or@@ ity of these aneurys@@ ms were sm@@ all@@ er than those of the control group (@@ 8 +/- 6.@@ 0@@ 8 mm versus 11 +/- 5.@@ 4 mm@@ ; P = 0.05@@ ). The differences in mor@@ t@@ ality and mor@@ b@@ idity between the two groups were not significant@@ . H@@ un@@ t and H@@ ess gra@@ de (P < 0.00@@ 5@@ ) and age (P < 0.00@@ 7@@ ) were significant predic@@ t@@ ors of outcom@@ e for the patients with cocaine -@@ related aneurys@@ ms . CONCLUSION: C@@ oc@@ aine use pre@@ dis@@ pos@@ ed aneurys@@ m@@ al ru@@ pt@@ ure at a significantly ear@@ li@@ er age and in m@@ uc@@ h sm@@ all@@ er aneurys@@ ms . C@@ ont@@ r@@ ary to the pu@@ bl@@ ished literat@@ ure, this group did reas@@ on@@ ably well with ag@@ gres@@ sive man@@ ag@@ em@@ ent@@ .

A selective antagonist of m@@ G@@ lu@@ R@@ 5, 2-@@ methyl@@ -@@ 6-@@ (@@ pheny@@ le@@ th@@ yn@@ yl@@ )@@ pyri@@ d@@ ine ( MP@@ E@@ P ; 5 mg/kg ip@@ ), when administered five times immedi@@ ately before each meth@@ amphetamine injection reversed the ab@@ o@@ ve@@ -@@ men@@ tion@@ ed meth@@ amphetamine effects. A single MP@@ E@@ P (@@ 5 mg/kg ip@@ ) injection reduced the bas@@ al extrac@@ ell@@ ular dopamine level in the striat@@ um, as well as dopamine release stimul@@ ated either by meth@@ amphetamine (10 mg/kg s@@ c@@ ) or by intra@@ striat@@ ally administered ver@@ atri@@ d@@ ine (@@ 100 micro@@ M@@ ). M@@ ore@@ o@@ ver, it transi@@ ently di@@ min@@ ished the meth@@ amphetamine (10 mg/kg s@@ c@@ )@@ -induced hyper@@ ther@@ mia and reduced bas@@ al body tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure. MP@@ E@@ P administered into the striat@@ um at high concentrations (5@@ 00 micro@@ M@@ ) increased extrac@@ ell@@ ular dopamine level@@ s, while lower concentrations (@@ 50@@ -@@ 100 micro@@ M@@ ) were de@@ v@@ oid of any effect@@ . The results of this study suggest that the block@@ ade of m@@ G@@ lu@@ R@@ 5 by MP@@ E@@ P may prot@@ ect dop@@ aminergic neuron@@ es against meth@@ amphetamine -induced toxicity . Ne@@ uro@@ prot@@ ection ren@@ de@@ red by MP@@ E@@ P may be associated with the reduction of the meth@@ amphetamine -induced dopamine eff@@ lu@@ x in the striat@@ um due to the block@@ ade of ext@@ ra@@ stri@@ atal m@@ G@@ lu@@ R@@ 5, and with a decrease in hyper@@ ther@@ mia .

A significant ri@@ se in cTn@@ T was found in DO@@ X rats after cum@@ ul@@ ative doses of 7.@@ 5 and 12 mg/kg in compar@@ ison with baseline (p@@ <@@ 0.05@@ ). cTn@@ T found in rats after 12 mg/kg were significantly greater than that found after 7.@@ 5 mg/kg DO@@ X .

A significant rel@@ ationship was observed between maxim@@ al cTn@@ T and the ext@@ ent of myocardial morph@@ ological chang@@ es, and between L@@ V di@@ ame@@ ter@@ s/@@ B@@ W and hist@@ ological find@@ ing@@ s. CONCLUSIONS: A@@ mon@@ g mark@@ ers of ischem@@ ic injury after DO@@ X in rats, cTn@@ T showed the great@@ est ability to det@@ ect myocardial damage assessed by echocardiograph@@ ic det@@ ection and hist@@ ological chang@@ es. Although there was a disc@@ re@@ p@@ anc@@ y between the amoun@@ t of cTn@@ I and cTn@@ T after DO@@ X , prob@@ ably due to he@@ ter@@ o@@ gene@@ ity in cros@@ s-@@ reac@@ ti@@ vi@@ ties of m@@ A@@ b@@ s to various cTn@@ I and cTn@@ T form@@ s, it is likely that cTn@@ T in rats after DO@@ X indic@@ ates cell damage determined by the mag@@ nit@@ ude of injury induced and that cTn@@ T should be a use@@ ful mark@@ er for the predic@@ tion of experim@@ ent@@ ally induced cardi@@ otoxicity and possib@@ ly for cardio@@ protective experim@@ ent@@ s.
