METHODS: Si@@ x@@ t@@ y female S@@ pra@@ gu@@ e-@@ D@@ aw@@ le@@ y (S@@ D) rats were random@@ ly divid@@ ed into three groups. The rats in the control group were intra@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ ally (@@ i.p.@@ ) injected with 0.@@ 9@@ % saline (@@ 4 ml@@ /@@ kg@@ ); the rats in the model group were i.@@ p@@ . injected with C@@ Y@@ P (1@@ 50 mg/kg@@ ); and the rats in the inter@@ ven@@ tion group were i.@@ p@@ . injected with C@@ Y@@ P with subsequ@@ ently per@@ f@@ usion of bladder with P@@ 2@@ X@@ 3 and N@@ K@@ 1 receptor@@ s@@ ' antagonist@@ s, S@@ ur@@ amin and G@@ R 8@@ 2@@ 3@@ 3@@ 4 .

P@@ ath@@ ological changes in bladder tissue were obser@@ ved. Im@@ mun@@ o@@ fluo@@ res@@ c@@ ence was used to det@@ ect the expression of P@@ 2@@ X@@ 3 and N@@ K@@ 1 receptors in blad@@ der@@ . RESULTS: C@@ yc@@ lo@@ phosph@@ amide treatment increased the spont@@ aneous pain behavi@@ ors sco@@ res@@ . The incidence of bladder in@@ st@@ ability during urine st@@ or@@ age period of model group was significantly higher than inter@@ ven@@ tion group (@@ X@@ (2@@ ) = 7.@@ 6@@ 19@@ , P = 0.00@@ 7@@ ) and control group (@@ X@@ (2@@ ) = 1@@ 3.@@ 7@@ 55@@ , P = 0.00@@ 0@@ ). M@@ C@@ C in the model group was lower than the control and inter@@ ven@@ tion groups (P < 0.0@@ 1). H@@ ist@@ ological changes ev@@ id@@ ent in model and inter@@ ven@@ tion groups rat@@ s@@ ' bladder included e@@ de@@ ma , vas@@ odi@@ l@@ ation, and inf@@ iltration of inflam@@ mat@@ ory cell@@ s.

E@@ igh@@ ty-@@ one perc@@ ent of patients with dyskine@@ sia had clinical f@@ l@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations.

The three significant predic@@ t@@ ors of dyskine@@ sia were duration of levo@@ dopa therapy, onset age, and total daily levo@@ dopa dose. CONCLUSIONS: The prev@@ al@@ ence of levo@@ dopa -induced dyskine@@ sia in our patients was 4@@ 4@@ %.

BACKGROUND: C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is a wi@@ de@@ ly used ant@@ ine@@ o@@ plas@@ tic@@ . One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose-@@ lim@@ it@@ ing nephro@@ toxicity . There are man@@ y strat@@ e@@ gi@@ es to prev@@ ent this toxicity , including the use of man@@ nit@@ ol as a nephro@@ prot@@ ect@@ ant in combination with hy@@ d@@ r@@ ation. OBJECTIVE: We a@@ im@@ ed to evalu@@ ate the rat@@ es of cisplatin -induced nephro@@ toxicity in cancer patients receiving sing@@ le@@ -@@ agent cisplatin with and without man@@ nit@@ ol . METHODS: This sing@@ le@@ -@@ c@@ ent@@ er ret@@ ro@@ sp@@ ective analysis was a qu@@ as@@ i experim@@ ent cre@@ ated by the n@@ ation@@ al man@@ nit@@ ol sh@@ ort@@ age. D@@ at@@ a were coll@@ ected on ad@@ ult cancer patients receiving sing@@ le@@ -@@ agent cisplatin as an out@@ patient from J@@ an@@ u@@ ary 20@@ 11 to S@@ e@@ pt@@ emb@@ er 20@@ 12@@ . The prim@@ ary outcom@@ e was acute kidney injury ( A@@ K@@ I ). RESULTS: We evaluated 14@@ 3 patients who received sing@@ le@@ -@@ agent cisplatin ; 9@@ 7.@@ 2@@ % of patients had he@@ ad and nec@@ k cancer as their prim@@ ary mal@@ i@@ gn@@ anc@@ y . Patients who did not recei@@ ve man@@ nit@@ ol were more likely to deve@@ lo@@ p nephro@@ toxicity : o@@ d@@ ds rati@@ o [@@ O@@ R@@ ] = 2.@@ 6@@ 4@@ 6 (@@ 95% C@@ I = 1.@@ 0@@ 0@@ 8@@ , 6.@@ 9@@ 4@@ 4@@ ; P = 0.0@@ 4@@ 8@@ ). Patients who received the 100 mg/m@@ (2@@ ) dos@@ ing and patients who had a hist@@ ory of hypertension also had a higher lik@@ e@@ li@@ ho@@ od of develop@@ ing nephro@@ toxicity : O@@ R = 1@@ 1.@@ 4@@ 9@@ 4 (@@ 95% C@@ I = 4.@@ 14@@ 9@@ , 3@@ 2.@@ 25@@ 8@@ ; P < 0.00@@ 0@@ 1) and O@@ R = 3.@@ 2@@ 1@@ 9 (@@ 95% C@@ I = 1.@@ 2@@ 2@@ 8@@ , 8.@@ 4@@ 3@@ 9@@ ; P = 0.0@@ 17@@ ), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Whe@@ n lim@@ ited qu@@ anti@@ ties of man@@ nit@@ ol are av@@ ail@@ able@@ , it should pre@@ fe@@ ren@@ ti@@ ally be given to patients at partic@@ ul@@ arly high risk of nephro@@ toxicity . Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dos@@ ing sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ e of 100 mg/m@@ (2@@ ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the great@@ est risk of nephro@@ toxicity and wo@@ uld ben@@ e@@ fi@@ t from the addition of man@@ nit@@ ol .

Ch@@ ild@@ ren are partic@@ ul@@ arly sensitive to DO@@ X -induced heart failure . He@@ re, the im@@ pac@@ t of p@@ 5@@ 3 inhibition on acute vs. lat@@ e-@@ st@@ age DO@@ X cardi@@ otoxicity was examined in a j@@ u@@ ven@@ ile model@@ . METHOD@@ S AN@@ D RESULTS: T@@ wo@@ -@@ week@@ -old M@@ HC@@ -@@ C@@ B@@ 7 mice (@@ which ex@@ pres@@ s domin@@ ant@@ -@@ inter@@ fer@@ ing p@@ 5@@ 3 in cardi@@ om@@ y@@ ocy@@ t@@ es@@ ) and their non-@@ trans@@ genic (N@@ ON@@ -@@ T@@ X@@ G@@ ) lit@@ ter@@ mat@@ es received week@@ ly DO@@ X injec@@ tions for 5 weeks (2@@ 5 mg/kg cum@@ ul@@ ative dose@@ ).

In combin@@ ation, these subst@@ anc@@ es are subst@@ anti@@ ally more toxic than either drug al@@ one. The@@ ir combined cardiac toxicity may be due to in@@ dependent effects of each drug@@ ; however, they may also be due to coca@@ eth@@ yl@@ ene ( C@@ E ), a cocaine metabol@@ ite form@@ ed only in the presence of eth@@ an@@ ol . The pur@@ p@@ ose of this study was to del@@ ine@@ ate the role of C@@ E in the combined cardi@@ otoxicity of cocaine and eth@@ an@@ ol in a model si@@ mul@@ ating their ab@@ use.

The selective block@@ ade of A@@ 2 aden@@ os@@ ine receptor by D@@ MP@@ X ( 3@@ ,@@ 7-@@ di@@ methyl@@ -1@@ -@@ pro@@ par@@ g@@ yl@@ x@@ an@@ th@@ ine ) significantly enhanced cocaine -induced locomotor activity of anim@@ al@@ s.

S@@ im@@ il@@ ar@@ ly, all aden@@ os@@ ine receptor agon@@ ist@@ s decreased amphetamine -induced hyperactivity , but at the higher doses than those which were active in cocaine -induced hyperactivity . The selective block@@ ade of A@@ 2 aden@@ os@@ ine receptors ( D@@ MP@@ X ) and non-@@ selective block@@ ade of aden@@ os@@ ine receptors ( caffe@@ ine ) significantly increased the action of amphetamine in the locomotor activity test@@ . Our results have shown that all aden@@ os@@ ine receptor agon@@ ist@@ s (A@@ 1 and A@@ 2) re@@ duce cocaine - and amphetamine -induced locomotor activity and indicate that cocaine -induced hyperactivity is more influ@@ enc@@ ed by aden@@ os@@ ine receptor agon@@ ist@@ s (@@ partic@@ ul@@ arly A@@ 1 receptor@@ s) than amphetamine -induced hyperactivity .

To qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y this po@@ pul@@ ation, the total number of ect@@ op@@ ic h@@ il@@ ar gran@@ ul@@ e cells was estim@@ ated using un@@ b@@ i@@ as@@ ed ste@@ re@@ ology at different times after pilocar@@ pine -induced status epilep@@ tic@@ us .

METHODS: S@@ ub@@ j@@ ects (n = 1@@ 14@@ ) under@@ go@@ ing extrac@@ tion of im@@ pac@@ ted thir@@ d mol@@ ar@@ s received either 2@@ % lidocaine or 0.@@ 5% bupivac@@ aine before surger@@ y and either ro@@ f@@ ec@@ ox@@ i@@ b 50 mg or placebo or@@ ally 9@@ 0 min before surger@@ y and for the following 4@@ 8 h@@ . O@@ ral m@@ u@@ co@@ s@@ al biop@@ si@@ es were tak@@ en before surger@@ y and 4@@ 8 h after surger@@ y. After extrac@@ tion, a micro@@ dialy@@ sis pro@@ be was pl@@ ac@@ ed at the surg@@ ical sit@@ e for PG@@ E@@ 2 and throm@@ b@@ ox@@ ane B@@ 2 ( T@@ X@@ B@@ 2 ) meas@@ ure@@ ment@@ s. RESULTS: The bupivac@@ aine / ro@@ f@@ ec@@ ox@@ i@@ b group reported significantly less pain , as assessed by a visual an@@ alo@@ g s@@ cal@@ e, compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h@@ . However, the bupivac@@ aine /@@ placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PG@@ E@@ 2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups. M@@ ore@@ o@@ ver, bupivac@@ aine significantly increased CO@@ X@@ -@@ 2 gen@@ e expression at 4@@ 8 h as compared with the lidocaine /@@ placebo group. Th@@ rom@@ b@@ ox@@ ane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatment@@ s, indicating that the effects seen were at@@ tri@@ but@@ able to inhibition of CO@@ X@@ -@@ 2, but not CO@@ X@@ -1@@ . CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that bupivac@@ aine stimul@@ ates CO@@ X@@ -@@ 2 gen@@ e expression after tissue injury , which is associated with higher PG@@ E@@ 2 pro@@ duction and pain after the loc@@ al anesthe@@ tic effect dis@@ si@@ pat@@ es.

BACKGROUND: Ne@@ uro@@ inflam@@ m@@ ation occur@@ s after seizures and is implic@@ ated in epile@@ pto@@ gene@@ sis. C@@ CR@@ 2 is a chemo@@ k@@ ine receptor for C@@ CL@@ 2 and their inter@@ action medi@@ ates mon@@ ocyte inf@@ iltration in the neuro@@ inflam@@ mat@@ ory cas@@ c@@ ade tri@@ g@@ ge@@ red in different brain path@@ olog@@ i@@ es. In this wor@@ k C@@ CR@@ 2 and C@@ CL@@ 2 expression were examined following status epilep@@ tic@@ us ( S@@ E ) induced by pilocar@@ pine injec@@ tion. METHODS: S@@ E was induced by pilocar@@ pine injec@@ tion. C@@ ont@@ ro@@ l rats were injected with saline in@@ ste@@ ad of pilocar@@ pine . F@@ i@@ ve days after S@@ E , C@@ CR@@ 2 st@@ aining in neuron@@ s and g@@ lial cells was examined using im@@ un@@ o@@ histo@@ chemical an@@ al@@ ys@@ es. The number of C@@ CR@@ 2 positive cells was determined using ste@@ re@@ ology prob@@ es in the hippocamp@@ us. C@@ CL@@ 2 expression in the hippocamp@@ us was examined by mol@@ ec@@ ular ass@@ a@@ y. RESULTS: In@@ c@@ reas@@ ed C@@ CR@@ 2 was observed in the hippocamp@@ us after S@@ E . S@@ e@@ iz@@ ures also resulted in al@@ ter@@ ations to the cell typ@@ es ex@@ press@@ ing C@@ CR@@ 2@@ . In@@ c@@ reas@@ ed numb@@ ers of neuron@@ s that ex@@ press@@ ed C@@ CR@@ 2 was observed following S@@ E . M@@ ic@@ ro@@ g@@ lial cells were more clo@@ se@@ ly ap@@ pos@@ ed to the C@@ CR@@ 2-@@ l@@ a@@ be@@ l@@ ed cells in S@@ E rats.

These C@@ CR@@ 2@@ + ast@@ ro@@ c@@ ty@@ tes were not observed in control rats. E@@ x@@ amin@@ ation of C@@ CL@@ 2 expression showed that it was elevated in the hippocamp@@ us following S@@ E . CONCLUSION: The data show that C@@ CR@@ 2 and C@@ CL@@ 2 are up@@ -@@ reg@@ ul@@ ated in the hippocamp@@ us after pilocar@@ pine -induced S@@ E . S@@ e@@ iz@@ ures also result in changes to C@@ CR@@ 2 receptor expression in neuron@@ s and ast@@ ro@@ cy@@ t@@ es.
