RESULTS: The two groups were compar@@ able with resp@@ ect to sex@@ , age, body weight and renal func@@ tion. No statis@@ tically significant differences were found in mean daily dose@@ , duration of treatment, or cum@@ ul@@ ative dose.

Two studies evaluated qu@@ e@@ ti@@ apine mon@@ o@@ therapy (@@ up to 8@@ 00 mg/@@ day@@ ) (n = 20@@ 9@@ ) versus placebo (n = 19@@ 8@@ ), with lithium or haloperidol mon@@ o@@ therapy as resp@@ ective active controls.

RESULTS: The incidence of EP@@ S -@@ related adverse event@@ s, including ak@@ athi@@ sia , was no different with qu@@ e@@ ti@@ apine mon@@ o@@ therapy (1@@ 2.@@ 9@@ %) than with placebo (1@@ 3.@@ 1@@ %). S@@ im@@ il@@ ar@@ ly, EP@@ S -@@ related adverse events with Q@@ T@@ P + L@@ i / D@@ V@@ P (2@@ 1.@@ 4@@ %) were no different than with P@@ B@@ O + L@@ i / D@@ V@@ P (1@@ 9.@@ 2@@ %). Ad@@ verse events related to EP@@ S occurred in 5@@ 9.@@ 6% of patients treated with haloperidol (n = 9@@ 9@@ ) mon@@ o@@ therapy, whereas 2@@ 6.@@ 5% of patients treated with lithium (n = 9@@ 8@@ ) mon@@ o@@ therapy experienced adverse events related to EP@@ S . The incidence of ak@@ athi@@ sia was low and similar with qu@@ e@@ ti@@ apine mon@@ o@@ therapy (@@ 3.@@ 3@@ %) and placebo (@@ 6.@@ 1@@ %), and with Q@@ T@@ P + L@@ i / D@@ V@@ P (@@ 3.@@ 6@@ %) and P@@ B@@ O + L@@ i / D@@ V@@ P (@@ 4.@@ 9@@ %). L@@ i@@ thi@@ um was associated with a significantly higher incidence (p < 0.05@@ ) of trem@@ or (1@@ 8.@@ 4@@ %) than qu@@ e@@ ti@@ apine (@@ 5.@@ 6@@ %@@ ); ce@@ re@@ bell@@ ar trem@@ or , which is a known adverse effect of lithium , may have cont@@ ri@@ but@@ ed to the elevated rate of trem@@ or in patients receiving lithium therapy. H@@ alo@@ perid@@ ol induced a significantly higher incidence (p < 0.00@@ 1) of ak@@ athi@@ sia (3@@ 3.@@ 3@@ % versus 5.@@ 9@@ %), trem@@ or (3@@ 0.@@ 3@@ % versus 7.@@ 8@@ %), and ext@@ ra@@ py@@ ram@@ idal syndrome (3@@ 5.@@ 4@@ % versus 5.@@ 9@@ %) than qu@@ e@@ ti@@ apine . No significant differences were observed between qu@@ e@@ ti@@ apine and placebo on S@@ A@@ S and BA@@ R@@ S sco@@ res@@ . An@@ ti@@ cholinergic use was low and similar with qu@@ e@@ ti@@ apine or placebo@@ . CONCLUSIONS: In b@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar man@@ ia , the incidence of EP@@ S , including ak@@ athi@@ sia , with qu@@ e@@ ti@@ apine therapy is similar to that with placebo@@ .

M@@ y@@ ocardi@@ al accum@@ ulation of [@@ 12@@ 5@@ I@@ ] M@@ I@@ B@@ G 4 h@@ r after intravenous injection did not diff@@ er between the controls and the groups treated 3 w@@ k or l@@ es@@ s.

BACKGROUND: The most stri@@ king of car@@ bo@@ pl@@ atin 's adv@@ ant@@ ages ( C@@ B@@ D@@ C@@ A ) over cisplatin ( C@@ D@@ D@@ P ) is its mark@@ ed@@ ly reduced rate of neuro@@ toxic effects. However, the use of C@@ B@@ D@@ C@@ A high@@ er@@ -@@ int@@ ensity sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ es and the association with other neuro@@ toxic drugs in poly@@ chemotherapy may cause some con@@ cer@@ n about its safety with resp@@ ect to peripheral ner@@ v@@ ous system damage . M@@ AT@@ E@@ R@@ I@@ AL@@ S AN@@ D METHODS: Two different sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ es of C@@ B@@ D@@ C@@ A administration (10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg i.@@ p@@ . tw@@ ic@@ e a week for n@@ ine tim@@ es@@ ) were evaluated in Wistar rats. Ne@@ uro@@ toxicity was assessed for behavioral (@@ t@@ ail@@ -@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ k test@@ ), neuro@@ physi@@ ological (@@ nerve con@@ duction ve@@ loc@@ ity in the t@@ a@@ il ner@@ ve@@ ), morph@@ olog@@ ic@@ al, morph@@ o@@ met@@ r@@ ical and analy@@ tical effects. RESULTS: C@@ B@@ D@@ C@@ A administration induced dose-@@ dependent peripheral neuro@@ toxicity . P@@ ain per@@ ce@@ ption and nerve con@@ duction ve@@ loc@@ ity in the t@@ a@@ il were significantly impa@@ i@@ re@@ d, partic@@ ul@@ arly after the high-dose treatment.

M@@ ore@@ o@@ ver, significant amoun@@ ts of pl@@ at@@ in@@ um were det@@ ected in the d@@ or@@ s@@ al ro@@ o@@ t g@@ ang@@ li@@ a and kidney after C@@ B@@ D@@ C@@ A treatment. CONCLUSIONS: C@@ B@@ D@@ C@@ A is neuro@@ toxic in our model@@ , and the type of path@@ ological changes it induc@@ es are so clo@@ se@@ ly similar to those caused by C@@ D@@ D@@ P that it is prob@@ able that neuro@@ toxicity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanis@@ m.

It is known that beta-@@ adren@@ oc@@ e@@ pt@@ or antagonist@@ s are effective in the treatment of ak@@ athi@@ sia , one of the ext@@ ra@@ py@@ ram@@ idal side effects that occ@@ ur during neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic treatment. Ne@@ uro@@ le@@ p@@ tic@@ -induced cat@@ al@@ ep@@ sy , a model of neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic@@ -induced ext@@ ra@@ py@@ ram@@ idal side effect@@ s, was considered su@@ it@@ able as a model for predic@@ ting neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic@@ -induced ak@@ athi@@ sia in hum@@ an@@ s, although neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic@@ -induced cat@@ al@@ ep@@ sy was not considered a specific test for neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic@@ -induced ak@@ athi@@ sia . The@@ refore, the effects of car@@ te@@ o@@ lol , a beta-@@ adren@@ oc@@ e@@ pt@@ or antagonist@@ , on haloperidol -induced cat@@ al@@ ep@@ sy in rats were behavi@@ or@@ ally studied and compared with those of prop@@ ran@@ o@@ lol and b@@ i@@ peri@@ de@@ n , a mus@@ car@@ inic receptor antagonist@@ . C@@ ar@@ te@@ o@@ lol , as well as prop@@ ran@@ o@@ lol and b@@ i@@ peri@@ de@@ n , inhibited the haloperidol -induced cat@@ al@@ ep@@ sy . The inhibit@@ ory effect of car@@ te@@ o@@ lol was al@@ most compar@@ able to that of prop@@ ran@@ o@@ lol , but was we@@ ak@@ er than that of b@@ i@@ peri@@ de@@ n . C@@ ar@@ te@@ o@@ lol did not evo@@ k@@ e post@@ syn@@ ap@@ tic dopamine receptor@@ -@@ stimul@@ ating behavioral signs such as ste@@ re@@ ot@@ yp@@ y and hyper@@ locom@@ o@@ tion in rats. C@@ ar@@ te@@ o@@ lol did not antagon@@ iz@@ e the inhibit@@ ory effects of haloperidol on apo@@ morphine -induced ste@@ re@@ ot@@ yp@@ y and locomotor activity in rats. In addi@@ tion, car@@ te@@ o@@ lol did not evo@@ k@@ e 5-@@ H@@ T@@ 1@@ A receptor@@ -@@ stimul@@ ating behavioral signs such as f@@ l@@ at body post@@ ure and fo@@ re@@ pa@@ w tre@@ ad@@ ing and did not inhib@@ it 5-@@ hydrox@@ y@@ tr@@ y@@ pto@@ ph@@ an -induced he@@ ad t@@ wit@@ ch in rats. F@@ in@@ ally, car@@ te@@ o@@ lol did not inhib@@ it ph@@ ys@@ os@@ tig@@ mine -induced le@@ thal@@ ity in rats. These results st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly suggest that car@@ te@@ o@@ lol impro@@ v@@ es haloperidol -induced cat@@ al@@ ep@@ sy vi@@ a its beta-@@ adren@@ oc@@ e@@ pt@@ or antagon@@ istic activity and is ex@@ p@@ ected to be effective in the treatment of ak@@ athi@@ sia without attenu@@ ating neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic@@ -induced anti@@ psycho@@ tic effects due to its post@@ syn@@ ap@@ tic dopamine receptor antagon@@ istic activ@@ ity.

RESULTS: The glomerul@@ i of human dia@@ be@@ tic nephro@@ pathy patients were under oxid@@ ative stres@@ s and had elevated N@@ r@@ f@@ 2 level@@ s. In the anim@@ al study, N@@ r@@ f@@ 2 was demonstrated to be c@@ r@@ uc@@ ial in ame@@ li@@ or@@ ating st@@ re@@ pto@@ z@@ ot@@ oc@@ in -induced renal damage .

The pur@@ p@@ ose of this revie@@ w was to per@@ form a ret@@ ro@@ sp@@ ective analysis to ex@@ amine whether there was a rel@@ ation between T@@ X@@ A us@@ age and seizures after cardiac surger@@ y.

All 24 patients with seizures received high doses of T@@ X@@ A intra@@ o@@ per@@ atively rang@@ ing from 6@@ 1 to 25@@ 9 mg/kg@@ , had a mean age of 6@@ 9.@@ 9 year@@ s, and 21 of 24 had under@@ g@@ one op@@ en ch@@ am@@ b@@ er ra@@ ther than coronary b@@ yp@@ as@@ s proce@@ du@@ res@@ .
