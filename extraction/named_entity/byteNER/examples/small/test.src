Serotonin receptor 2A HTR2A gene polymorphism predicts treatment response to venlafaxine XR in generalized anxiety disorder Generalized anxiety disorder GAD is a chronic psychiatric disorder with significant morbidity and mortality Antidepressant drugs are the preferred choice for treatment however treatment response is often variable Several studies in major depression have implicated a role of the serotonin receptor gene HTR2A in treatment response to antidepressants We tested the hypothesis that the genetic polymorphism rs7997012 in the HTR2A gene predicts treatment outcome in GAD patients treated with venlafaxine XR Treatment response was assessed in 156 patients that participated in a 6 month open label clinical trial of venlafaxine XR for GAD Primary analysis included Hamilton Anxiety Scale HAM A reduction at 6 months Secondary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement CGI I score at 6 months Genotype and allele frequencies were compared between groups using Ï‡ 2 contingency analysis The frequency of the G allele differed significantly between responders 70 and nonresponders 56 at 6 months P 0 05 using the HAM A scale as outcome measure Similarly using the CGI I as outcome the G allele was significantly associated with improvement P 0 01 Assuming a dominant effect of the G allele improvement differed significantly between groups P 0 001 odds ratio 4 72 Similar trends were observed for remission although not statistically significant We show for the first time a pharmacogenetic effect of the HTR2A rs7997012 variant in anxiety disorders suggesting that pharmacogenetic effects cross diagnostic categories Our data document that individuals with the HTR2A rs7997012 single nucleotide polymorphism G allele have better treatment outcome over time Future studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to further characterize this effect in treatment response to antidepressants in GAD
