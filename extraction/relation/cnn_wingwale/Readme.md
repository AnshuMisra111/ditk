## Overview
* A relation extraction model that uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Tensorflow implementation
* Input sentence is first broken down into word tokens, and each word is transformed into a word embeddings vector
* Lexical and sentence level features are extracted and concatenated to form the final feature vector
    * Sentence level features are obtained through a max-pooled CNN
* The final feature vector is fed into a softmax classifier to determine the relation type
